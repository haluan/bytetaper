## Transitive and system dependencies

ByteTaper may also link against transitive or system libraries depending on the
build environment, package manager, and final distribution format.

These may include, but are not limited to:

* C and C++ runtime libraries
* pthread / system threading libraries
* zlib
* bzip2
* lz4
* snappy
* zstd
* OpenSSL or another TLS/crypto provider
* Abseil
* c-ares
* RE2
* other gRPC, Protobuf, RocksDB, or distribution-level dependencies

The exact transitive dependency set can differ between local builds, CI builds,
Linux distribution packages, and container images.

Before releasing a binary or container image, inspect the final artifact and
include any additional required notices.

## Vendored source files

If ByteTaper vendors any third-party source files, generated files, `.proto`
definitions, headers, or patches, the original copyright notices and license
headers must be preserved.

Do not replace upstream license headers with ByteTaper headers.

If a third-party file is modified, add a clear modification notice where
appropriate, while preserving the original upstream notice.

## Distribution note

This notice file is intended to describe ByteTaper's direct third-party
dependencies. It does not replace a full dependency audit of the final release
artifact.

For every source, binary, package, or container distribution, ensure that:

1. The applicable full license texts are included.
2. Required copyright notices are preserved.
3. Required NOTICE or attribution files from upstream projects are retained.
4. The final dependency inventory or SBOM matches the actual released artifact.
